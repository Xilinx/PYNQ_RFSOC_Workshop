    "# Introduction to PYNQ RFSoC\n",
    "\n",
    ">Welcome to the PYNQ RFSoC Workshop! This collection of notebooks act as a  guide on RFSoC development within the context of PYNQ, as well as exhibiting some of the RFSoC's unique features.\n",
    ">    \n",
    ">We cover a lot of material but we strive to explain everything in as much detail as possible without being too overwhelming. To start off, we introduce the hardware and software that will be used over the course of the workshop. We then jump straight into the RFSoC hardware, interacting with both the RF data converters and the SD-FECs. Finally we spend some time showing what a Python/PYNQ development story looks like by doing some basic DSP in both software and FPGA hardware.\n",

    "### What is PYNQ?\n",
    "\n",
    "PYNQ is an open-source project from Xilinx Research Labs that makes it easy to design embedded systems with Zynq and Zynq Ultrascale+ SoCs. It \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Python language and libraries, designers can exploit the benefits of the PS and PL to build more capable and exciting embedded systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PYNQ Python library provides support for low level control of an overlay (bitstream) including memory-mapped IO read and write, memory allocation, and control and management of these overlays.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Who is PYNQ for?\n",
    "\n",
    "PYNQ is intended to be used by a wide range of designers and developers including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Software developers who want to take advantage of the capabilities of Zynq and Zynq Ultrascale+, and programmable hardware without having to use ASIC-style design tools to design hardware.\n",
    "- System architects who want an easy software interface and framework for rapid prototyping and development of their Zynq or Zynq Ultrascale+ design.\n",
    "- Hardware designers who want their designs to be used by the widest possible audience.\n",

    "## Introduction to JupyterLab\n",
    "\n",
    "JupyterLab is an interactive environment that allows users to create and interact with notebooks that include features such as:\n",
    "- Live code\n",
    "- Interactive widgets\n",
    "- Plots\n",
    "- Narrative text\n",
    "- Equations\n",
    "- Images\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we will exclusively use Python in these notebooks, JupyterLab supports a range of different programming languages such as R, Haskell, Ruby and Scala. For each notebook that you open, the web application starts a kernel that runs the code for that notebook. It's interesting to note that the notebook server is running on the ARM processor of the board, as well as all the code you run in the cells. This means your laptop browser's job is just rendering the graphics, just like a web page!\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter environment is a feature-rich one and it would be impossible (and unnecessary) to learn everything about it in this workshop. This introduction aims to get you up to speed with enough knowledge to help you through the rest of the notebooks but, if you would like to learn more about Jupyter, then feel free to visit their [website](https://jupyter.org/) and read through the [documentation](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Navigation\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two different sets of keyboard shortcuts: one set that is active in edit mode and another in command mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important keyboard shortcuts are Enter, which enters edit mode, and Esc, which enters command mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "In edit mode, most of the keyboard is dedicated to typing into the cell's editor. Thus, in edit mode there are relatively few shortcuts. In command mode, the entire keyboard is available for shortcuts, so there are many more:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Basic navigation: enter, shift-enter, up/k, down/j\n",
    "   - Saving the notebook: s\n",
    "   - Change Cell types: y, m, 1-6, t\n",
    "   - Cell creation: a, b\n",
    "   - Cell editing: x, c, v, d, z\n",
    "   \n",
    "JupyterLab also has a toolbar on the left hand side of the screen which includes things like a file broswer and a list of running kernels. You can open this by clicking on one of the icons on the side, and close it by clicking again on the icons. It is good practice to shutdown kernels when you have finished with them, so keep an eye on what you have open from time to time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to stop or restart the kernel at any point; cut, copy or paste information to/from cells; or execute the current cell, these functions are available on the toolbar at the top of this notebook.\n",

    "### Running code\n",
    "\n",
    "First and foremost, the notebook is an interactive environment for writing and running code. Let's start off by running the code in the cells below. Navigate to the cell below and press Shift-Enter (or press the play button in the toolbar above) to run the cell and move on to the next one."
