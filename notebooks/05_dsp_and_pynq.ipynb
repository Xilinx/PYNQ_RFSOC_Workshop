    "> Now we've come to the end of the workshop, we can review what has been covered over the five notebooks. We've demonstrated some of the key features of the RFSoC, including the RF data converters and SD-FECs, and shown how PYNQ can be used to interact with them in a simple and intuitive way. We have also shown off some of the more interesting features of Python and what a typical workflow looks like when using it for DSP development. At the heart of it all is JupyterLab, which gives us the perfect platform on which to show features with text, images, and visualisation - making PYNQ a great tool for demonstrating Xilinx hardware.\n",
