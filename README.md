# PYNQ RFSoC Workshop

A collection of designs and notebooks for the PYNQ &amp; RFSoC workshop — part of the ZCU111's [PYNQ image](http://www.pynq.io/board.html).

## Getting started

On ZCU111 PYNQ SD card images, these notebooks are already included. The steps to get started with this image are:

  1. Download the "ZCU111 PYNQ image" file from the [PYNQ website](http://www.pynq.io/board.html).
  
  2. Refer to the PYNQ docs for steps to:
     * [burn the image](https://pynq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/appendix.html#writing-the-sd-card) to an SD card, and
     * [configure your network interface](https://pynq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/appendix.html#assign-your-computer-a-static-ip-address)
    
  3. Navigate to `http://<IP address>/lab` for the new JupterLab interface. We use features that aren't in the default interface.
     
  4. Attach a SMA loopback cable between the DAC/ADC pair as shown below.

</p>

Now you're ready to use the notebooks in the `rfsoc_workshop` folder, as highlighted below:

## Building from source

> This step is *optional*. Only continue if you want to build your own image.

You can recreate this workshop manually if, for example, you want to use it on a different PYNQ image.
Clone this repo and manually install the constituent RFSoC overlays:
  1. [RFSOC-QPSK](https://github.com/strath-sdr/rfsoc_qpsk)
  2. [SDFEC-PYNQ](https://github.com/Xilinx/SDFEC-PYNQ)
  3. [DSP-PYNQ](https://github.com/Xilinx/DSP-PYNQ)

Run `make install` to deploy the workshop notebooks to the `rfsoc_workshop` folder.

## Hosting a lab session

Note that there is a `make install` target that will replace the notebooks with the original copies. Use this to do a soft reset between groups.

## FAQ

  * Q: Which RFSoC boards are supported?
    + Currently the ZCU111 is the only officially supported board
    
  * Q: Can I run these notebooks on my custom RFSoC board?
    + You can build a PYNQ image for a custom board by following [these steps](https://github.com/Xilinx/PYNQ/tree/master/sdbuild). You will also likely need to rebuild the Overlays used in this lab — for support please raise an issue on the relevant repo ([Data Converter](https://github.com/strath-sdr/rfsoc_qpsk), [SD-FEC](https://github.com/Xilinx/SDFEC-PYNQ), or [DSP](https://github.com/Xilinx/DSP-PYNQ))
    
  * Q: Where can I get general support?
    + There is a public forum for PYNQ at https://discuss.pynq.io/, where you can ask (or respond to) questions about this lab and more
  
  * Q: Which version of Vivado was used to build these Overlays?
    + Vivado 2020.1 was used for the latest build of Overlays
  
  * Q: There is erroneous or zero data on the receive path in the "PYNQ & Data Converter" notebook
    + Check that the SMA cable is connected to the correct ports on the daughtercard (as shown in this README)
    
  * Q: The plots do not appear in the "PYNQ & Data Converter" notebook
    + Check that you are using the Jupyter **Lab** interface. Try navigating to `http://<IP address>/lab`
